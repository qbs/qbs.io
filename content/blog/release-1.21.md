title: Qbs 1.21 Released
date: '2022-01-11'
author: Ivan Komissarov

The [Qbs build tool](http://qbs.io) version 1.21.0 is available.

Qbs is a community-driven language-agnostic build automation system. It is fast
and offers an easy-to-learn language based upon QML.

## What's new

About 105 contributions went into this release since version 1.20.0. We have
selected a few items below. Have a look into the complete
[changelog](https://code.qt.io/cgit/qbs/qbs.git/tree/changelogs/changes-1.21.0.md)
if you are interested in more details.

### Named Module Providers

We redesigned the [module providers](https://doc.qt.io/qbs/module-providers.html) feature.
Previously, when Qbs encountered a missing module (say, Qt.core), it searched for a provider
that can generate that module based on the module name - Qbs consecutively searched for providers
named "Qt.core", "Qt" until it found one. This limited the ways to use providers -
ultimately, it was possible to have only one provider for each framework such as
Qt or Boost. Thus, we introduced the new [qbsModuleProviders](https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qbs-master/qml-qbslanguageitems-product.html#qbsModuleProviders-prop) property to Product and
[Project](https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qbs-master/qml-qbslanguageitems-project.html#qbsModuleProviders-prop)
items which allows to specify which providers are run.

For example, to invoke the [Qt provider](https://doc.qt.io/qbs/qml-qbsmoduleproviders-qt.html)
explicitly in your product, you can do the following:

```
CppApplication {
    Depends { name: "Qt.core" }
    files: "main.cpp"
    qbsModuleProviders: ["Qt"]
}
```

It is also possible to prioritize modules generated by different module providers (did I mention
the new [qbspkgconfig](https://doc.qt.io/qbs/qml-qbsmoduleproviders-qbspkgconfig.html) provider?) -
providers contribute to the qbsSearchPaths in the order specified by the qbsModuleProviders.

In the following example, the "Qt.core" module can come both from the "Qt" provider and the
"qbspkgconfig" provider, but modules generated by the "Qt" provider have higher priority as it
comes first in the list. This can be useful when you want to use a custom Qt installation (Qt
provider will try to locate qmake in PATH) but also have a fallback for a system Qt
provided by pkg-config.

```
CppApplication {
    Depends { name: "Qt.core" }
    files: "main.cpp"
    qbsModuleProviders: ["Qt", "qbspkgconfig"]
}
```

We plan to add more providers, such as VCPKG or Conan provider in the future.

### qbspkgconfig provider

Originally, Qbs used to use the "fallback"
[provider](https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qbs-master/module-providers.html#how-qbs-uses-module-providers)
based on the pkg-config tool when searhed module was not generated by any other provider. There
are several problems with the "fallback" provider - it always tries to generate a module using
pkg-config, even for non C++ projects such as Java projects; it does not properly support
packages that have special characters in their names - such names cannot be the name of a Qbs module
(e.g. "python-3.9" contains a "." which is a qualified-id separator). Also, the "fallback" provider
invoked the pkg-config tool several times per module due to limitations of the pkg-config CLI,
which could lead to bad performance when using multiple packages in a project.

So, we added the new [qbspkgconfig](https://doc.qt.io/qbs/qml-qbsmoduleproviders-qbspkgconfig.html)
provider which uses the internal C++ library for reading .pc files. This allows Qbs to have
the information about dependencies between pkg-config packages (that info is lost when using
the pkg-config tool) and generate modules with respective [dependencies](https://doc.qt.io/qbs/qml-qbsmoduleproviders-qbspkgconfig.html#mergeDependencies-prop). Also, this works much faster
as we now avoid expensive forking for the pkg-config process.

The new provider and the underlying library mimic the pkg-config tool behavior as much as possible
but something might work a bit differently (not always intentional, so feel free to submit
bug reports/suggetions).

## General

* capnproto and protobuf modules can now use runtime provided by the new qbspkgconfig provider.
* Qbs no longer migrates the "profiles/" dir from earlier Qbs versions (QTCREATORBUG-26475).
  Old directories might be cleaned up manually.
* We fixed a problem on FreeBSD when QBS did not track changes in files correctly due to the fact
  it used low-precision file times (with milliseconds excluded). Now Qbs always uses high-precision
  file times on all OSes which may not be supported by some older UNIXes - if you are user of such
  OS, please report a bug.
* A new ConanfileProbe.verbose property was added which can be useful to debug problems with
  Conan.

## C/C++ Support

* Added support for C++23.
* Add Elbrus E2K architecture for the GCC toolchain
  [QBS-1675](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QBS-1675).

## Android Support

* A new Android.ndk.buildId
  [property](https://doc.qt.io/qbs/qml-qbsmodules-android-ndk.html#buildId-prop) was added which
  allows to overwrite the default value (sha1) for the --build-id linker flag.

Qbs is also available from a number of package repositories
([Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/qbs),
[MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/ports.php?by=name&substr=qbs),
[Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/qbs)) and is updated on each
release by the Qbs development team. It can also be installed through
the native package management system on a number of Linux distributions.
