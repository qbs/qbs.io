<!--more-->

This is a minor bugfix release that contains some fixes such as:

* Fixed handling of non-string exceptions
  ([QBS-1734](https://bugreports.qt.io/projects/QBS/issues/QBS-1734)).
* Fixed Utilities.versionCompare() for four-segment versions numbers
  ([QBS-1733](https://bugreports.qt.io/projects/QBS/issues/QBS-1733)). This fixes compiler
  feature detection for the clang-cl toolchain.
* Fixed support for static plugins and Qt >= 6.5 as well as improved handling of .prf files which
  provide info about Qt libraries. This fixes build for the iOS platform with the recent Qt
  versions ([QBS-1732](https://bugreports.qt.io/projects/QBS/issues/QBS-1732)).
