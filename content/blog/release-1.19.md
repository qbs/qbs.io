The [Qbs build tool](http://qbs.io) version 1.19.0 is available.

Qbs is a community-driven language-agnostic build automation system. It is fast
and offers an easy-to-learn language based upon QML.

## What's new

About 151 contributions went into this release since version 1.18.0. We have
selected a few items below. Have a look into the complete

### Codesign module

A new [codesign module](https://doc.qt.io/qbs/qml-qbsmodules-codesign.html) that implements
code signing for Apple, Android and Windows platforms has been added.

On Apple platforms, it is now possible to sign application bundles as well as standalone
executables. By default, Qbs uses Xcode specs to understand whether it should enable codesigning.
For example, codesigning is now enabled for iOS (non-simulator) builds, but not enabled for
macOS, matching Xcode behavior. To sign an application for the Darwin platform, one
should specify the codesign.signingIdentity and codesign.provisioningProfile properties:

```
CppApplication {
    files: "main.m"
    codesign.enableCodeSigning: true
    codesign.provisioningProfile: "my provisioning profile name"
    codesign.signingIdentity: "Apple Development: My Team Name"
}
```
Unlike Xcode, Qbs does not support auto-detection of the signingIdentity based on the
provisioningProfile (yet).

For more information, see the [How-To section](https://doc.qt.io/qbs/howtos.html#how-do-i-sign-an-application-for-an-apple-platform)

On the Android platform, it is possible to sign Aab and Apk packages. A typical example can be
written as follows:

```
QtGuiApplication {
    files: "main.cpp"
    codesign.enableCodeSigning: true
    codesign.keystorePath: "path to the keyStore file"
    codesign.keystorePassword: "keystore password"
    codesign.keyPassword: "key password"
    codesign.keyAlias: "key alias"
}
```

On Windows, to sign a standalone executable using the
[signtool.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/tools/signtool-exe), one can
specify the codesign.certificatePath and codesign.certificatePassword properties:

```
CppApplication {
    files: "main.m"
    codesign.enableCodeSigning: true
    codesign.certificatePath: "C:\certs\mycert.pfx"
    codesign.certificatePassword: "p@ssw0rd"
}
```

### C/C++ Support

- Qbs now supports multiple MSVC compiler versions installed in one Visual Studio installation
  as well as multiple Windows SDK versions (QBS-1498). Also, multiple compiler versions are
  properly detected by qbs setup-toolchains - Qbs will create a separate profile for every
  compiler version.

- Added support for the HCS08 architecture to SDCC and IAR toolchains (QBS-1631, QBS-1629) as
  well as support for the HCS12 architecture to GCC and IAR toolchains (QBS-1630, QBS-1550).

- Auto-detection of the Keil toolchains has been fixed.

### Other
- Added support for Android NDK 22.1.7171670.
- Added support for Xcode 12.5 (QBS-1644).
- Fixed support for Qt 6.1 (QBS-1636).
