<!--more-->

This is a minor bugfix release that contains several important fixes such as:

* Fixed crash when importing missing JavaScript file
  ([QBS-1730](https://bugreports.qt.io/projects/QBS/issues/QBS-1730)).
* Fixed building applications with mingw toolchain and Qt6
  ([QBS-1724](https://bugreports.qt.io/projects/QBS/issues/QBS-1724)).
* Added support for Xcode 14.3.
* Fixed codesigning on macOS ([QBS-1722](https://bugreports.qt.io/projects/QBS/issues/QBS-1722)).
* Fixed detecting Xcode via the xcode-select tool.
* Partially fixed Qt support on iOS for Qt6 (Qt versions up to 6.3 should work now correctly)
  ([QBS-1732](https://bugreports.qt.io/projects/QBS/issues/QBS-1732)).
* Qt is no longer being set up in qbspkgconfig provider when cross compiling
  ([QBS-1717](https://bugreports.qt.io/projects/QBS/issues/QBS-1717)).
